### Master ###

### Description ###
This specialization allows students to conduct extensive research and delve deeply into the dramatic, functional, and aesthetic dimensions of the overall design project, including the reuse of materials (dramatically) in different ways and perspectives, depending on the required scene and within the context of the "spirit of the text".
It also helps students learn about all innovative technical solutions and how to translate them towards the higher goal of the directorial vision (material techniques and their visual effects, their service to the subject, the strength of their connotations, and their capacity to convey multiple concepts and visions).
